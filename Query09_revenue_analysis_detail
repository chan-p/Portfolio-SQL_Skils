List to see the revenue per each inventoried copy, average rental duration per each rental, total revenue, daily rental rate, along with other basic film information for analyses

/* Noted that the payment amount for each rental was not the same as what is defined as the rental rate in the film table 
Based on this, made an assumption that the payment amounts per rental vary based on the number of days rented
Calculated the daily rental rates baesd on the default rental_duration and rental_rate defined in the films table
Then, the number of actual days rented was calculated using the total payment amount of each film */
